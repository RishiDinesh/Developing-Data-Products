## Documentation for myApp

This Shiny App uses the USArrests datasets that is part of the R datasets Package. This data set contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living in urban areas. It is a simple app that summarises and plots the various crime types in the US grouped by State.

All the user has to do is select the type of crime rate from the options provided in the sidebar. The app will then generate a heatmap showing the crime rates for that crime across every state in the US. It will also tabulate the information shown in the heatmap and provide a summary of that information along with a scatterplot. This scatterplot shows the variation in the crime rate with variation in urban population and is fitted with a regression line for better understanding.
